    country with the best educational resource (the NPTEL courses), 
    Chitralekha expands the MHRD's mission and ideology in a way that is 
    both flexible and rational, offering students a much brighter and wider 
    range of opportunities to master the topics. I personally discovered that 
    the tool is continually improving assisting in advanced translations`,

    content: `I recently translated the NPTEL course "C Programming and Assembly 
    Language" using the Chitralekha tool. I must express my appreciation for 
    the tool, as it delivers the lecture content very nicely in the local 
    language. I am thrilled to see the regional audio output, which I prepared 
    during the voiceover process, the lecture content came out very well. 
    Now, I feel the readers can watch the content in their native language 
    without having to worry about the language barriers and not having to go 
    through long lecture transcripts. 
    The overall application is impressive, and I believe the tool adds great 
    value to the translation and voiceover process.`,
